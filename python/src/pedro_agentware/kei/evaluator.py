"""Policy evaluation backed by kei-proxy.

Enforcement belongs in the shared library, not in each agent harness. Any
harness that builds an ``AuditedToolClient`` with a :class:`KeiProxyEvaluator`
is governed by construction: the same authorization call, the same vocabulary
translation, and the same fail-closed behaviour, without reimplementing them.

The evaluator talks to kei-proxy through an injected :class:`AuthorizationClient`
so it is testable with no proxy binary present. Agentware deliberately does not
import any harness package -- a library must not depend on its consumer.
