"""Audited tool client.

Python port of ``go/middleware/tool_client.go``. Wraps a tool function so that
every call is evaluated against policy before execution and recorded to the
audit log afterwards, giving callers a small surface -- a function in, a result
out -- instead of requiring them to assemble a Middleware, a PolicyEvaluator
and an Auditor themselves.
